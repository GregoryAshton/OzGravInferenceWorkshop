# OzGravInferenceWorkshop

A repository for the July 2018 OzGrav inference workshop. In this repository you'll find the timetable, location information,
and lecture materials. Many of these will be added before the workshop begins and then we will add to this as we go. If you
find think we are missing something let us know.

## Local organisation

All three days of the workshop will be hosted in Studio 2 (ground floor), School of Physics and Astronomy, 10 College Walk, Clayton Campus.

## Using this repository

This repo is publically accessible and anyone can navigate through the links to find the material. If you would like a
local copy, anyone with or without a github account can
[clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) using 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/GregoryAshton/OzGravInferenceWorkshop.git
```

### Preparation

To get the most out of the workshop, we recommend you bring your laptop and power supply as many of the
session will be interactive. You may also wish to have a working installation of python. If you are worried
about having any of this ready, come along to the workshop early where we can help you make sure you are
ready to go.
